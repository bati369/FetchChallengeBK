Documentation for setting up and executing a test using TestNG with Java:

## 1. Introduction

TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit, but with added features to make it more powerful and easier to use. It's designed to cover all categories of tests: unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc.

## 2. Cloning and Setting up the TestNG Framework with Java Project
      Prerequisites:
      a) Java Development Kit (JDK) - Ensure that you have JDK installed on your machine.
      b) Maven - This guide assumes that the project uses Maven as a build and dependency management tool.
      c) Git - You'll need Git to clone the repository.
      
      Steps:
      I-Clone the Repository
      
      Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you'd like to clone the repository. 
      Run:
      $ git clone [URL_OF_THE_REPOSITORY]
      Replace [URL_OF_THE_REPOSITORY] with the actual GitHub repository URL.
      
      Navigate to the Project Directory
      
      II-Once cloned, navigate to the project directory:
      
      $ cd [PROJECT_DIRECTORY_NAME]
      Replace [PROJECT_DIRECTORY_NAME] with the name of the cloned directory.
      
      III-Install Dependencies using Maven
      
      Run the following command to install required dependencies:
      
      $ mvn clean install
      This will download the necessary dependencies and compile the project.
      
      IV-Running the Test
      
      The project has a predefined Maven goal to execute tests. To run the test, use:
      
      $ mvn test
      
      Or you can run the test from the "testng.xml" file
      
      V-Reviewing the Results
      
      After executing the tests, Maven will provide a summary of the tests that have passed, failed, or were skipped.
